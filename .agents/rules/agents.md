# Best practices
- No need to test your changes automatically unless explicitlly asked for
- Only make changes that the user specifically asked for.
- Don't overemphasize on executing the code via terminal for verification. User will verify it manually, unless asked for
- Keep changes simple and focused to what the user asked
- Don't write tests unless explicitly asked for
